As a part of course requirement, we had to model using surfacing an existing car's 3D scan data. Along with a classmate, I made Alfa-Romeo Giulietta as a part of this project. This project has been the most important teacher. This helped me learn many things related to 3D modeling. I still work on learning it. I have also learnt SolidWorks, ProE after Catia. <br>A small screen shot is present on the left.</p>
